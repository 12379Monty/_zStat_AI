## Assistant Response 1

Based on my searches, I found some relevant statements from Terry Speed, the Australian statistician, relating to AI and related fields like data science and machine learning. Here's what I discovered:

### Terry Speed's Key Statements on AI/Data Science

#### On Data Science (his most direct statement on the AI/data science debate):

Speed commented on the data science movement, asking: "Are we doing such a bad job that we need to rename ourselves data scientists to capture the imagination of future students, collaborators, or clients? Are we so lacking in confidence … that we shiver in our shoes the moment a potential usurper appears on the scene? Or, has there really been a fundamental shift around us, so that our old clumsy ways of adapting and evolving are no longer adequate?"

He continued with a defense of statistics' enduring value: "I think we have a great tradition and a great future, both far longer than the concentration span of funding agencies, university faculties, and foundations. … We might miss out on the millions being lavished on data science right now, but that's no reason for us to stop trying to do the best we can at what we do best, something that is far wider and deeper than data science."

#### On Machine Learning and Statistics:

In a 2006 column and 2016 AMSTAT interview, Speed observed that computer science, machine learning, image analysis, information theory and bioinformatics have all provided future statisticians to statistics departments around the world in recent years, and that "there are misunderstandings on both sides about what statistics and statisticians can and should do." He characterized the data science movement as "a necessary correction for our community" while acknowledging that "there is no doubt in my mind that there are real and important issues here, mixed in with the usual human characteristics of exaggeration (hype), oversimplifying, competition for resources (turf battles), and so on."

#### Current AI Research:

More recently, Speed has been part of a team at WEHI that developed AI-based methodology to remove unwanted variation from biomedical data, showing his practical engagement with machine learning methods in his genomics work.

Speed's perspective appears to be that of a pragmatic statistician who values what works over ideological debates about methodology, while defending statistics as a discipline with deeper foundations than any single technological wave.

### Additional Findings on Terry Speed

#### Background
Terry Speed (born 1943) is an Australian statistician known for:
- Professor at UC Berkeley (Statistics) and WEHI (Bioinformatics)
- Expert on microarray analysis and statistical genetics
- 2013 Prime Minister's Prize for Science winner
- Long-running IMS Bulletin column "Terence's Stuff" (now discontinued)

#### On "Principled" Methods (2016 IMS Bulletin column):

Speed objected to describing statistical methods as "principled," arguing: "If a statistical analysis is clearly shown to be effective … it gains nothing from being … principled." He criticized the implication that other approaches are "unprincipled."

#### On Statistician Perceptions (2014 IMS column cited by Bin Yu):

Speed quoted an outsider view that statisticians "don't deal with risk, with uncertainty… we're too absolute, we do p-values, confidence intervals, definite things like that." Scientists wanted "actionable insight" not "arcane concerns about mathematical methods."

#### 2023 WEHI AI Work:

Speed's team (with Papenfuss, Molania) developed AI-based methodology to remove unwanted variation from biomedical data, published in Nature Biotechnology. Applied to Cancer Genome Atlas (10,000 patient samples, 33 cancer types).

#### Summary Characterization:

Speed's stance: pragmatic defender of statistics as discipline while acknowledging legitimate critiques. Values what works over ideological purity. Skeptical of hype and rebranding but engaged with ML methods in practice. Sees statistics as having "wider and deeper" foundations than data science trends.

**Note:** No direct statements found specifically about deep learning, neural networks, ChatGPT, or LLMs.

## Assistant Response 3

Based on my search, I found a compilation of blog entries from Andrew Gelman's "Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science" blog that mention Michael Jordan. Note that the blog discusses multiple Michael Jordans: Michael I. Jordan (the Berkeley statistician/ML researcher), Michael J. Jordan (the basketball player), and Michael B. Jordan (the actor).

https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2014/10/23/michael-jordan-didnt-say/

This post discusses a controversy over an IEEE Spectrum interview with Jordan about AI and big data. Bob Carpenter notes that Jordan claimed it was "patently false" to think there is any neuroscience behind current Deep Learning and machine learning techniques, and that we are "not yet in an era" where we can use brain understanding to create intelligent computer systems. The post includes a lively debate in comments between the journalist Lee Gomes and readers about the accuracy of the interview framing.

#### 2. "The ML uncertainty revolution is … now?" (August 5, 2021)

Bob Carpenter comments: "You have people like Michael Jordan who straddle the fields and produce students straddling the fields like Dave Blei, Tamara Broderick, and Francis Bach. What's funny is that I vividly remember talks by Jordan and Hinton in psychology (CMU psych was big into 'connectionism') in the 1980s and early 90s on neural nets that everyone in CS just yawned through."

#### 5. "Stan Down Under" (February 15, 2015)
https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2015/02/15/stan-3/

Bob Carpenter mentions Google search diversity, noting: "you don't get 1000 hits for Michael Jordan the basketball player before the first hit for Michael Jordan the computer scientist (or maybe vice-versa these days?)."
