@article{Halling:2012ab,
	abstract = {With our ever-increasing understanding of the molecular basis of disease, clinical laboratories are implementing a variety of molecular diagnostic tests to aid in the diagnosis of hereditary disorders, detection and monitoring of cancer, determination of prognosis and guidance for cancer therapy, and detection and monitoring of infectious diseases. Before introducing any new test into the clinical laboratory, the performance characteristics of the assay must be "verified," if it is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or FDA-cleared test, or "validated," if it is a laboratory-developed test. Although guidelines exist for how validation and verification studies may be addressed for molecular assays, the specific details of the approach used by individual laboratories is rarely published. Many laboratories, especially those introducing new types of molecular assays, would welcome additional guidance, especially in the form of specific examples, on the process of preparing a new molecular assay for clinical use.},

@article{ETO:2012aa,
	abstract = {Technologies collectively called omics enable simultaneous measurement of an enormous number of biomolecules; for example, genomics investigates thousands of DNA sequences, and proteomics examines large numbers of proteins. Scientists are using these technologies to develop innovative tests to detect disease and to predict a patient's likelihood of responding to specific drugs. Following a recent case involving premature use of omics-based tests in cancer clinical trials at Duke University, the NCI requested that the IOM establish a committee to recommend ways to strengthen omics-based test development and evaluation. This report identifies best practices to enhance development, evaluation, and translation of omics-based tests while simultaneously reinforcing steps to ensure that these tests are appropriately assessed for scientific validity before they are used to guide patient treatment in clinical trials.},
